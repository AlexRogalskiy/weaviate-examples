# Weaviate examples

List of examples and tutorials of how to use the Vector Search Engine
Weaviate for cool machine-learning related tasks.

### Running Weaviate

* Most examples assume you have a Weaviate running. You can run one locally by following [this installation guide](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/getting-started/installation.html#customize-your-weaviate-setup) in the documentation.
  * If you need a specific vectorizer module or another ML module, it will be explained in the tutorial.
