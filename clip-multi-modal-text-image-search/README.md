# Multi-Modal Text/Image search using CLIP

![Weaviate Multi-Modal Search](./weaviate-multi-modal-clip-search-demo.png)

This example application spins up a Weaviate instance using the
[multi2vec-clip]() module, imports a few sample images (you can add your own
images, too!) and provides a very simple search frontend in
[React](https://reactjs.org/) using the
[weaviate-multi-modal-clip-search-demo.png
](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/client-libraries/javascript.html)

It is a minimal example using only 5 images, but you can add any amount of
images yourself!

## Prerequisites to run it yourself
- Docker & Docker-Compose
- Bash
- Node.js and npm/yarn if you also want to run the frontend

## Run it yourself

1. Start up Weaviate using `docker-compose up -d`
2. Import the schema (the script will wait for Weaviate to be ready) using `bash create_schema.sh`
3. Import the images using `bash import.sh`
4. To run the frontend navigate to the `./frontend` folder and run `yarn && yarn start`. Wait for your browser to open at `http://localhost:3000`

## How to run with your own images

Simply add your images to the `./images` folder prior to running the import
script. The script looks for `.jpg` file ending, but WWeaviate supports other
image types as well, you can adopt those if you like.
