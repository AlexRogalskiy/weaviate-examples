# Semantic search of wines with Weaviate

This folder contains code used for the [Hackernoon article: "What Is Weaviate And How To Create Data Schemas In It"](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-weaviate-and-how-to-create-data-schemas-in-it-7hy3460).

The schema can be used to import a dataset of [wines from Kaggle (from WineEnthusiast)](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).

This example is a very basic schema. The default configuration of the vectorization module and Weaviate is taken. Tweaking settings can be learned from [the documentation](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/modules/text2vec-contextionary.html#per-class-configuration).
